Please add any additional notes hereâ€¦

- The 'cards' and 'sizes' datasets have already been merged so i have decided to use the 'cards' dataset and remove the 'sizes' dataset to avoid confusion.

- The expected endpoint for GET /cards/:card003 on the readme appears to have incorrect available sizes and pages. I have chosen to ignore this as I believe it is a mistake.

- I decided to code in JavaScript as I am much more comfortable with it, however I have used .ts files instead of .js just incase I decided to go back and use TypeScript for leaning purposes.
